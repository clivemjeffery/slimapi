# Slimapi

A fork of Slim-Doctrine-Demo to pick through the process of hosting on my shared server.

A project to demonstrate how to integrate Doctrine 3.x into Slim. This is the companion code for the Cookbook entry [Using Doctrine with Slim] in Slim's documentation.

## Server config

I needed the .htaccess files described here [https://discourse.slimframework.com/t/running-in-a-sub-directory/5893] and in another article on the Slim site.

I also needed to add the following:

```php
// public/index.php
$app->setBasePath('/tryslimapi');
```

## Requirements

- PHP 8.2+
- PHP SQLite extension
- [Composer]

All met on both dev and server.

## Overview

The Slim-Doctrine-Demo project is a small REST API that allows its clients to
[create and retrieve lists of users.]()

- GET /users    -> Retrieves a list of all users created so far.
- POST /users   -> Creates a new user (does not accept any parameters, fake data is autogenerated).

At its core, Doctrine's `EntityManager` is used to persist and retrieve these users from an SQLite database.

```

## Running the app
Typing `composer serve` in a console will install the project dependencies, create the database and open the API at `http://localhost:8000`. Once it is running you can make requests against it with a browser, curl or similar tools.

The following worked on dev and to server.

```bash
$ curl -X POST localhost:8000/users
```

## Using the Doctrine Command Line Interface

Run `./bin/doctrine` (this script needs the project dependencies, so run `composer install` first).

## Running the tests

Similarly, typing `composer test` will take care of loading the testing environment and running PHPUnit. If the XDebug exension is enabled code coverage results will be available at `var/coverage/` after running the tests.
